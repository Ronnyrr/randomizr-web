# Randomizr
This project includes a React application to random generate questions for a weekly standup at your company, icebreakers and design challenges. The code project is created from the idea of [my React Native project](https://github.com/Ronnyrr/randomizr). This project was a POC for code re-usage between native and web. Also this project is used as a playground to work with [the animation library React Spring](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring). In this example some basic Transtions and a Parallax is used.

## Getting Started
`$ git clone git@github.com:Ronnyrr/randomizr-web.git`

`$ cd randomizr-web && npm install`

`$ npm start` (run in development mode)

## Credits
[React Prime](https://github.com/JBostelaar/react-prime) is used as boilerplate for this React project.
